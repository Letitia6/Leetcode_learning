# 518. Coin Change 2



This is a classic knapsack problem.

`dp[i][j]` : the number of combinations to make up amount `j` by using the first `i` types of coins
`State transition`:

1. not using the `i`th coin, only using the first `i-1` coins to make up amount `j`, then we have `dp[i-1][j]` ways.
2. using the `i`th coin, since we can use unlimited same coin, we need to know how many ways to make up amount `j - coins[i-1]` by using first `i` coins(including `i`th), which is `dp[i][j-coins[i-1]]`

```python
Initialization`: `dp[i][0] = 1
```



```python
dp = [0] * (amount + 1)
        dp[0] = 1
        for i in coins:
            for j in range(i, amount + 1):
                dp[j] += dp[j - i]
        return dp[amount]
```
